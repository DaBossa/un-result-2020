                                <p>The collaboration between the Government of Myanmar, the Defeat-NCD Partnership and stakeholders in Myanmar, resulted in the successful Development of a national NCD costed operational plan for Myanmar covering 2021 and 2022. The plan aims to support 11 million people in 2021 and 2022, with a focus on screening and treatment for five NCDs. The plan, successfully implemented, will benefit 2 million vulnerable people with free-of-charge NCD care, and the overall delivery of the plan is expected to reduce out-of-pocket expenses from the current level of 82% down to 63%.</p>

Accordingly, we worked with the Rwanda Biomedical Centre to organise a successful training and knowledge sharing event on 19 and 20 September 2020. 12 internationally renowned health professionals, working on the frontline of COVID-19 clinical care joined 275 clinicians from Rwanda to exchange information on treatment guidelines and protocols, emerging trends and latest research.</p>
