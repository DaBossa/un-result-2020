The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted the world for more than a year, bringing about economic and social upheavals, without mentioning the suffering and losses that so many people around the world have had to endure. Like most organizations, COVID-19 affected UNITAR’s work since much of its programming is usually delivered in the field. By leveraging its virtual learning environment, mobile learning and other available IT tools, UNITAR was able to continue its learning services despite COVID-related restrictions and its many negative impacts, the world of learning has actually become more interconnected during the pandemic.</strong></p>

In the Solomon Islands, the local authorities needed support to monitor the quarantine stations over the archipelago. Our geospatial dashboard allowed the visualization of the different stations on satellite imagery, and also integrated the provided data on the occupancy such as the number of active cases, nationality, gender, etc. per station. This interactive tool provided daily-updates and supported decision-making processes on numerous programmes and policies, including for COVID-19 monitoring and measure implementation.</p>
